# DOM Project

This project demonstrates the use of dynamic DOM manipulation and interactive features with JavaScript. The project contains elements like custom cursors, hover effects, and click-based animations to enhance user experience.

## Features

### 1. Add Friend Button
- **Functionality**: Clicking the "Add Friend" button changes the status from "Stranger" to "Friends" and the button label to "Remove."
- **Toggle**: Clicking again reverts the status back to "Stranger" and the button to "Add Friend."

### 2. Double Click Heart Animation
- **Functionality**: Double-clicking on the image triggers a heart animation that briefly enlarges and fades out.

### 3. Custom Cursor
- **Functionality**: A custom circular cursor follows the user's mouse movements, creating a unique browsing experience.

### 4. Dynamic Image on Hover
- **Functionality**: Hovering over images triggers them to follow the mouse pointer dynamically, adding an interactive effect.

### 5. Instagram Story Section
- **Functionality**: A scrollable circular section showcases profile images, simulating Instagram-style stories. Clicking on an image expands it to full screen, mimicking the story-viewing functionality.
